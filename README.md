# Important Notice
Before, I want to say that this design is not mine, I'm just recreating it using NuxtJS + Tailwind, and is not for commercial usage, is just to test my skills and for fun, if you are interested in using the design please, first negotiate with the creator in [uplabs](https://www.uplabs.com/posts/google-translate-web-app)

# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
